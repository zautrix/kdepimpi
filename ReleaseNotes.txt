This package is for users of the Open Zaurus ROM 3.3.6,
compiled by coredump (aka known as Hentges-Rom).
The programs may run on the new
Open Zaurus Release 3.5.1 as well, but
they cannot be installed there properly,
because the package manager of OZ needs more
information in the ipk files to install them properly.

If you have Open Zaurus 3.5.1, you should use
the packages of the OZ 3.5.1 feed,
compiled and maintained by Hrw.
Do not ask the OZ people about problems with these
packages, they cannot help you.

CONTENT:

By the way, I cannot help you as well, because I
am not using OZ.

*****************************************************
4) Linux Desktop (SuSE 9.2)
*****************************************************

Filename: KDE-Pim-Pi-X.X.XX-SuSE_9.2.i586.rpm
Package contains:
KAddessbook/Pi
KOrganizer/Pi
PasswordManager/Pi
KPhone/Pi
KTimeTracker/Pi
KOPieMail/Pi
and the needed microkde libs.

Download file and install it on console with
su
rpm -ihv KDE-Pim-Pi-X.X.XX-SuSE_9.2.i586.rpm
Note:
If you want to update, please do it with
rpm -Uhv KDE-Pim-Pi-X.X.XX-SuSE_9.2.i586.rpm
(Uninstall with rpm -e KDE-Pim-Pi-X.X.XX-SuSE_9.2)

Here is the information,
provided in the rpm file about the content:

This package contains the platform-independent PIM programs from
www.rogowski.info, compiled for SuSE 9.2:
KTimeTacker/Pi
KPhone/Pi
KAddressbook/Pi
KOrganizer/Pi
PasswordManager/Pi
KOpieMail/Pi

These applications do not need anything from the KDE-desktop
at all to run on Linux. However, there is a dependency from
two KDE libs, because a small command line program is included
to make it possible to sync with the KDE-desktop applications.

These applications are independent from the KDE-desktop
environment. That means, nothing of your existing
KDE-desktop setup will be changed, or any data
(calendar-addressbook) used by the KDE-desktop
applications will be changed or accessed.
These applications stores their data and config in
$HOME/kdepim/
However, because the same file format is used,
an easy exchange of data with the KDE-desktop
is possible.
A small command line program is included
to make it possible to sync with the KDE-desktop applications.
You do not need to call this program from the commandline,
it is called from the KDE-Pim/Pi apps when you choose there:
Sync with KDE_Desktop.
If something is going wrong, please start the
KDE-Pim/Pi program itself from the console to get detailed output.

After installation, you should have a
PIM-pi
folder in your KDE start menu, where you can
start the applications from.

These programs makes it possible to sync your Zaurus easily
(with the KDE-Pim/Pi programs running on the Zaurus)
with the KDE-desktop calendar/addressbook data.
If you want to use that, you have to update your
KDE-desktop to version 3.3.0 or higher.
SuSE 9.2 contains KDE 3.3.0 such that no update is needed.
Actually - after the (non difficult) configuration is set up -
with two mouseklicks on the Zaurus,
the Zaurus syncs with the corresponding KDE-Pim/Pi
program on the Linux Desktop which syncs automatically
with the KDE-desktop data.

If you want to use the KDE-desktop calendar/addressbook applications,
just install these apps in this package and use them as a syncing tool for the
Zaurus <-> KDE-desktop sync.
The sync requires a network connection from your Zaurus to
the PC. A detailed Sync HowTo is available in the
Help menu of the applications.

These applications makes it also possible, that you can sync
(or just export the data to) your mobile phone with your
data of the KDE-desktop calendar/addressbook applications.
This is tested and working for Nokia mobile phones,
it may work with others as well.
(More info about that: -> Sync HowTo)

NOTE:
When using SuSE 9.1 you have to update your KDE to 3.3.x
and you have to make an online update in SuSE 9.1 to make it
possible to get the infrared connection working, such that
you can sync your (Nokia) mobile phone via infrared.


*****************************************************
5) Memory Stick edition:
*****************************************************

If you download the memory stick edition you do not have to download kdepimdll.zip. The memory stick edition contains all needed files! It contains binary files of KO/Pi and KA/Pi for WindowsXP, WindowsME and Linux and the needed libs. In the memory stick edition KO/Pi and KA/Pi are already configured to run from a memory stick and to save the data to the memory stick. You may have problems to run the Linux versions of KO/Pi or KA/Pi on Linux from a MS-Dos formatted memory stick.  That depends on your Linux distribution.
