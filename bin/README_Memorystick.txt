 
This package contains the versions of 
the calendar application KOrganizer/Platform-independent (KO/Pi)
and the addressbook application KAddressbook/Platform-independent (KA/Pi)
for Windows 2000/XP, Windows 98/Me and Suse Linux 9.2.

It needs nothing be installed, just run the binaries from this directory.
(Note: On Linux it seems  not to be possible to run an executable program fom a MS-Dos formatted memory stick. In that case you have to copy the complete content of the KDE-Pim/Pi dir to th local device and copy your data changes ( data is stored in <KDE-Pim/Pi dir>/kdepimpi )back to the stick.
That does mean you can put all the files on a memory stick and run it from the stich on every computer with  Windows 2000/XP, Windows 98/Me or Suse Linux 9.2.

The Windows 98/Me version is like the Windows 2000/XP version, but has not the "Import from Outlook" feature.

The Windows 2000/XP version has an "Import from Outlook" feature in the import menu which makes it easy to get the data from Outlook into KDE-Pim/Pi.

The Suse Linux 9.2 version has a "Sync with KDE" feature in the sync menu which makes it easy to sync the data from KDE with KDE-Pim/Pi.
