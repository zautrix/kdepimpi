Now it is possible, that you as a user can make a translation 
and see the result immediately in KO/Pi.

If you want to translate a language from western europe (with Latin1 characters)
you should set the language to German and translate the file germantranslation.txt.

If you want to translate a language which needs utf8 support
you should set the language to "usertranslation.txt" and translate the file usertranslation.txt.
Propably the file usertranslation.txt is not up to date - such that it is recommended to
copy the file germantranslation.txt over the file usertranslation.txt.
The file germantranslation.txt always includes the latest strings to translate.

To choose the language, please do:

Choose menu Actions-Configure. There the TAB Locale.
Choose "User defined" as language (or German) and restart.
Now all the text is translated using the file usertranslation.txt (or germantranslation.txt).
This file is located on Zaurus in 
/home/QtPalmtop/pics/kdepim/korganizer/usertranslation.txt.
On Windows, it is in 
(your install dir)\kdepim\korganizer\usertranslation.txt.
This file includes as a default the complete German translation of KO/Pi.
(NOTE don't forget to copy germantranslation.txt over the file usertranslation.txt before you start).
I.e. if you start KO/Pi for the first time with option
"User defined", you will get the German Version.
Just replace the German words in the file usertranslation.txt 
by words of your own language.
You can check the results immedialtely by starting KO/Pi.
You can do the translation on Windows
with the Windows KO/Pi Version to test.
Or on the zaurus, if you have some spare time somewhere ...

Howto translate:

An entry is of the kind
{ "&Addressbook","&Adressbuch" },
i.e. 
{ "englishtext","translatettext" },
Note, that the separation mark between the two texts MUST be  "," ,
not " ," or ", " or  " , " or something other!

The & in &Addressbook stands for an 'a' as keyboard shortcut. 
Please place the & in front of the same char in your translation or leave it out.

Note, that the text should fit on the small display of an 5500.
The given english text and german translation does fit.

In messageboxes, there is sometimes long text used.
Do make text using a new line, you have to use '\n'.
Example:
{ "Backup file\nalready exists!\nOld backup file from:\n%1\nOverwrite?\n","Backup Datei\nexistiert bereits!\nAlte Backup Datei vom:\n%1\nÜberschreiben?\n" },

You can set the '\n' in the text where you want, 
but you have to make shure, that the text does 
fit on the small display of an 5500.

Sometimes translation texts have a parameter or two, 
where some text is inserted at runtime. 
These parameters are %1, %2 and so on.
In the example above we have the parameter %1, 
which stands for the file name. 
You can place this parameter in the pext where you want. 
But don't forget to use it. 
And be aware, that the parameter text has some length 
and the parameter text should fit on the small display of an 5500.
Sometimes only a number is filled in for a parameter. 
In this case, the length of the parameter is not a big problem.

To use a " itself as a char in the translated text, you have to put a \ in front of it, like in the example: 
{ "Color for Sundays + category \"Holiday\"","Farbe für Sonntag + Kateg.\" Feiertag\"" },

Please send the translated text to
zautrix@rogowski.info
such that I can add it to the program package and 
other users can benefit from your translation work.
