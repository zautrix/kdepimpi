8) 
Recurring todos:
In KO/Pi you can define recurring todos.
(You may replace in the following date by datetime).
A recurring todo must have a due date and a start date.
The recurrence is computed from the start date.
As usual, in the views is shown the due date.
If you set a reccuring todo to complete, is it shown as complete
and the next recurrence is computed automatically.
You can now set the todo back to uncomplete.
If you do not set it back to uncomplete,
it will be automatically set back to 
(after the next update of a view in KO/Pi)
uncomplete when the current datetime passes the
start date of the todo.
To set the start/due back to other dates simply change the
start/due values in the todo editor.
Recurring todos are not deleted on a "purge completed".
