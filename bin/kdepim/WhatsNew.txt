********** VERSION 2.3.0 ************ (02-2017)

Linux desktop version compiled for 
q4os with trinity desktop environment running on Raspberry/pi.

********** VERSION 2.2.12 ************

Minor fixes for display of cancelled items in KO/Pi:
Added config option "Show cancelled events/todos" for What's Next View.

Started porting to Qt4. 

********** VERSION 2.2.11 ************

Fixed some problems in the multi resource pi-sync mode for calendars.(KO/Pi sync).
Implemented the multi resource pi-sync mode for contact data.(KA/Pi sync).
Added more information to the pi-sync mode dialog boxes to make syncing easier to understand.

Added in KO/Pi a "Show next alarm" to the action menu.

Reordered the menu structure of the KO/Pi alarm applet for the Zaurus.
Now important funtionality is easier to access.

********** VERSION 2.2.10 ************

Fixed some compilation issues on Suse 10.3.
(i.e. with gcc (GCC) 4.2.1 (SUSE Linux))

Changed display of cancelled todos in What'sNextView:
Now a cancelled todo is not shown in What'sNextView.

Fixed a problem when syncing recurrent todos.

********** VERSION 2.2.9 ************

Again I added some features I was missing...

Added in KO/Pi alarm applet for the zaurus the possibility to
- set the suspend duration for the next suspended alarm
- display the currently suspended alarm and remove it

Fixed in KO/Pi What'sNext view the display of recurring multiday and allday events.

Changed in KO/Pi What'sNext view the display of multiday events.
Now for events longer than 3 days only the start date and the end date of the event is displayed.
Fixed in  What'sNext view some problems with recurring todos.
Added to the action menu the possibility to change quickly the number of displayed days in the What'sNext view.

Added to overdue todos in  What'sNext view the info about how many days that todo is overdue.

Added to the list view and search list a column "proi" which display the priority of todos.

Added to the print dialog (only available in desktop versions) when printing todos another feature: Now you can specify the number of topmost prios of todos you want to print out. E.g. you can print only your todos of priority 1-2.


********** VERSION 2.2.8 ************


I forgot what I fixed...

Some minor fixes in KA/Pi and KO/Pi.

KA/Pi uses popup menu now for quick category selection in contact edit dialog.

In the Pi-syc mode of KO/Pi it is now possible to define specific resources which can be synced with the remote pi-sync server.
This feature must be considered as unstable - it still needs some more testing.

On Wintendo now KA/Pi can sync with Outlook. The configuration of the sync needs some moer tweking.
Fixed some gcc 4.xx compilation probs.
Fixed an annoying cursor focus reset problem when editing and (auto-)saving journal enries in KO/Pi.


********** VERSION 2.2.7 ************

Added for Desktop Versions (Windows + Linux) the possibility to specify an email client to call if the user clicks on an emailaddress.
(Menu: Config->Global Settings->Extern.Applications: E-mail).
Added as default (and example) Mozilla Thunderbird settings.
If the path to the binary in this  Mozilla Thunderbird example is not matching your environment you can take these settings as an template and configure "User defined email client".

********** VERSION 2.2.6 ************

KO/Pi:
Made navigation in datepicker more userfriendly when using keyboard for scrolling.
KO/Pi Alarm applet:
Made font size for the two popup menus with larger font configurable:
Change size with menu:
Play Beeps->Font Size
Save settings such that it will be restored after next reboot with menu:
Play Beeps->Config->Save.
KA/Pi:
Big change! Needed for the upcoming Outlook sync:
(Outlook sync available appr. end of 2005)
Telephone number types are now fixed in KA/Pi 
(but still compatible with the vCard standard, of cource)
and they are compatible with the types used by the evil empire.
That makes syncing with OL possible and make it possible to sync better with mobile devices.
NOTE:
All your telephone types will be converted automatically at loading/importing!
Such that it may be a good idea to make a backup of the data before starting KA/Pi.
But the editing of phone numbers and types has changed completely such that it is now much faster to edit/change types and numbers.
HINT:
To see whether there was some number for some contact not converted senseful, choose
Menu: View->Modify view
and add "Other Phone" ( in German "Sonst. Telefon") to the view.
If a type was not converted senseful to some of the 18 new, fixed types, it will get the "Other" type.

********** VERSION 2.2.5 ************

Bugfixes in KO/Pi, KA/Pi and OM/Pi.
Added possibility to disable auto saving in KO/Pi.
How to disable it? Good question! Next question, please?
Added info about count of events/todos/journals to calendar info.


********** VERSION 2.2.4 ************

KO/Pi alarm applet: Made font smaller and added a dealy before starting KO/Pi to avoid problems accessing data storage when an alarm did wake up the Z.
Added 3 sec notification about a started timer.

KO/Pi: 
Added export option for all data to File->Export menu.
Better management if a save error occours.
Added 15 sec delay in automatic saving when Z wake up from suspend and the automatic save timer did expire -  to avoid problems accessing data storage directly after wake up.
Fix for displaying month names of an utf8 translated language (like Russian). I hope a Russian version of KO/Pi will be available soon.

Added duration info about multiday events.
Changed behaviour of "Set complete" in Todo viewer: Now Todo viewer closes not automatically.

KA/Pi:
Added for vCard import the option to import contact data in Latin1 format.

********** VERSION 2.2.3 ************

KO/Pi:
Fixed a problem with (non empty) exception dates in the exception date edit dialog of recurring events for newly created events.

Fixed usability problem in KA/Pi:

Changed some behaviour in OM/Pi mail management to make it more usable.
