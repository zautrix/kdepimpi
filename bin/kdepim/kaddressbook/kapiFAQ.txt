Q:  
For which platform is KA/Pi available?
A: 
KA/Pi is the platform-independend version of KAddressbook and it 
includes a replacement for the KDE libraries called microkde.
It can be compiled to any platform, where Qt is available.
The source code  compiles without modifications on Windows, 
Linux Desktop and Sharp Zaurus PDA. 
Precompiled versions and the source code cvs can be found at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kdepimpi/

Q:
I can not install KA/Pi on the SD card (ext2 formated), 
it can be installed only in the internal memory. 
What can I do ? 
A:
KA/Pi and friends are now installable on SD-Card!
It is recommended to install all libs and apps
on the SD card or all in the internal storage.
There may be problems, if this is mixed.
If you get an error when installing,
simply install the other packages and try again.

Q:
KA/Pi startup time is very slow. What can I do ?
A:
If not neede, disable all extensions in
Settings/Configure KAddressbook/Addressbook/General
and restart Ka/Pi.

Q:
Can I receive contacts via infrared (IR) directly with KA/Pi?
A:
Yes, KA/Pi can receice data via IR when it is running!

You have to do:
- disable FastLoad for the original addressbook application and close it
- start KA/Pi
- enable IR beam/receive

Note: When FastLoad is enabled for KA/Pi, KA/Pi is always running and
you do not need to "start" KA/Pi.

Q:
It looks like I can not import the original addressbook into Ka/Pi
There is no menu entry that supports my ROM.   
A:
When Ka/Pi starts, it tries to load all existing addressbook access
libraries. Those libraries again are trying to load ROM dependent libs.
If one of those related libs is missing, the menu will not inlcude an entry
for that addressbook type.
The following access libraries are available:

ROM: OpenZaurus and old Sharp format (qtopia, XML format)
libname: libmicrokabc_qtopia.so
linked to: no external libs needed

ROM: new Sharp format (DTM database format)
libname: libmicrokabc_sharpdtm.so
linked to: libqpe, libqte, libzdtm, libsl
