Sync HowTo Zaurus <-> KDE


This is a
Sync HowTo Zaurus <-> K-Desktop Environment(KDE)
using the KDE-Pim/Pi applications 
KAddressbook/Pi (KA/Pi) and KOrganizer/Pi (KO/Pi)
on the Zaurus (Z).

You can now easily sync your Z with the 
PIM data of the KDE.
(addressbook and calendar data).
You need to install the desktop versions 
of KA/Pi+KO/Pi on the desktop.
You need KDE version 3.3.0 or higher on your desktop.
You need KA/Pi+KO/Pi version 1.9.11 or higher on the desktop
and on the Z.

NOTE: Almost the same procedure will make it possible to
sync KA/Pi+KO/Pi running on Windows with KDE via network.

The setup+sync procedure is:

0) How the syncing works
1) Installing KA/Pi+KO/Pi on the Z
2) Installing desktop version of KA/Pi+KO/Pi on the desktop
3) Connection your Z to the desktop via network
   (network connection can be set up via USB cable or (W)Lan
4) Configuring KA/Pi+KO/Pi on Z for Sync
5) Enable remote sync in KA/Pi+KO/Pi on the desktop
6) Sync

*****************************************************
0) How the syncing works
*****************************************************

After setting up everything, the following actions will
be performed when syncing:
User enables "remote pi-sync" on desktop.
User chooses "sync with configured desktop profile" on the Z.
Z sends sync request via network to configured IP/port/password.
KO/Pi on desktop detects sync request and syncs with KDE (configurable!).
A window pops up, that KO/Pi on desktop is in "remote syncing mode".
If a conflict occurs when syncing KO/PI<->KDE on the desktop, 
automatically the newest entry is choosen.
(To avoid the need of user interaction)
KO/Pi on desktop sends synced file to Zaurus.
KO/Pi on desktop is in "waiting mode" to get synced file back.
Zaurus is syncing it's own calendar with the received file.
Here can be some user interaction needed, i.e.
if the sync profile is configured as
"ask for every entry on conflict" and a conflict occurs. 
Zaurus sends back synced file to desktop.
Syncing on Zaurus is complete now.
KO/Pi on desktop gets back synced file.
KO/Pi on desktop removes all entries in its own calendar and
reloads the synced file.
KO/Pi on desktop syncs with KDE.
After syncing  with KDE is finished, KO/Pi closes
the "remote syncing mode" window and displays 
a "syncing complete" message in the headline.

The actual syncing KO/Pi on desktop <-> KDE is 
performed by a small command line tool "kdecaldump", 
which writes/reads the complete KDE calendar resources to 
a file/from a file.
KO/Pi tags changed entries such that an unchanged entry
is not changed in KDE by kdecaldump. That is important for 
calendar entries in KDE, stored in a "disconnected IMAP" calendar resource.


Same way is KA/Pi working.


*****************************************************
1) Installing KA/Pi+KO/Pi on the Z
*****************************************************

Download latest version of KA/Pi+KO/Pi from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kdepimpi/
Project KDE/Pim.
Direct link is:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104103&package_id=112604
Click on the version number to read the release notes/change log.
Choose there the right precompiled package for your Z:
For Sharp ROM
-File: kdepim_1.x.xx_for_SharpROM.ipk.zip
For Open Zaurus ROM:
-File: kdepim_1.x.xx_for_OZ-gcc3xx.ipk.zip
If unsure, choose:
-File: kdepim_1.x.xx_for_SharpROM.ipk.zip

Unzip the file and install the packages as usual on your Z.
In order to intstall KA/Pi+KO/Pi on your Z,
you need to install the following files:
kmicrokdelibs_1.x.xx_arm.ipk  
kaddressbook_1.x.xx_arm.ipk
korganizer_1.x.xx_arm.ipk

*****************************************************
2) Installing desktop version of KA/Pi+KO/Pi on the desktop
*****************************************************

Precompiled packages are available for SuSE 9.1.
Choose on the above download location:
File: KDE-Pim-Pi-1.9.11-SuSE9.1.i586.rpm
Download file and install it on console with
su
rpm -ihv KDE-Pim-Pi-1.9.11-SuSE_9.1.i586.rpm
NOTE:update with 
            rpm -Uhv KDE-Pim-Pi-1.9.11-SuSE_9.1.i586.rpm
     erase (uninstall) with
            rpm -e KDE-Pim-Pi-1.9.11-SuSE_9.1     
NOTE for users of SuSE 9.1:
You need KDE version 3.3.0 or higher on your desktop.
Plese make an online update in SuSE (YAST), then update
your KDE to version 3.3.0 or higher.
You can find links to updated precompiled versions of KDE 
for SuSE 9.1 on the SusE web site, 
a direct link is for example:
ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/suse/ftp.suse.com/suse/i386/supplementary/KDE/update_for_9.1
HOWTO UPDATE KDE:
Download there the packages in "base".
And the needed package for your language in "internationalization".
Put all downloaded files in one "installation" directory.
Open console and go to the downloaded "installation" directory.
Do there a
su
and then perform a test for the update:
rpm -Uhv --test *.rpm

If no dependencies are shown, you can do the actual update with 
rpm -Uhv *.rpm

If there are missing dependencies, you can resolve them by
- download the needed updated KDE package from the 
    "applications" or from the "development" folder on the server.
- adding a needed rpm package from the SuSE install DVD
- remove the package that has dependencies from your "installation" directory.

Do the 
rpm -Uhv --test *.rpm
until you get no dependencies and no errors, then do a
rpm -Uhv *.rpm
Run
SuSEconfig
after installing with rpm is finished.
Restart KDE.

*****************************************************
3) Connection your Z to the desktop via network
   (network connection can be set up via USB cable or (W)Lan
*****************************************************

a) Connection via network cable/(W)Lan cards
   Connect your desktop to the network.
   Set up networking on the Z.
   Make sure, you can ping the desktop from Z.
b) Connection via USB cable:(is working for Z 7x0 and Z5500)
   (i) Open console on desktop and type
           su
           tail -f /var/log/messages
   (ii) Connect your Z with the USB cable to your desktop
        You should get as output in the above console 
        something like this:
        ("BUG" is the name of the desktop computer!)
            Oct 26 12:49:37 BUG kernel: usb 2-2: new full speed USB device using address 2
            Oct 26 12:49:37 BUG kernel: usb 2-2: Product: SL-C860
            Oct 26 12:49:37 BUG kernel: usb 2-2: Manufacturer: Sharp
            Oct 26 12:49:37 BUG /etc/hotplug/usb.agent[22659]: need a device for this command
            Oct 26 12:49:43 BUG kernel: usb0: register usbnet at usb-0000:00:1d.0-2, Sharp Zaurus, PXA-2xx based
            Oct 26 12:49:43 BUG kernel: usbcore: registered new driver usbnet
        You see in the 5. line ("BUG kernel: usb0: register"), that usb device usb0 is used.
   (iii) Create a network startup entry in /etc/sysconfig/network
         Depending of the number X of the used usb device, create a file 
         /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-usbX
         (in our case /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-usb0 )
         with the following content:
               # usbX config for Zaurus
               IPADDR='192.168.129.200'
               NETMASK='255.255.255.0'
               NETWORK='192.168.129.0'
               BROADCAST='192.168.129.255'
               STARTMODE='hotplug'
   (iv) Disconnect the Z and connect the Z again to the desktop.
        Now you should be able to ping the Z from the desktop, try in console on desktop:
        ping 192.168.129.201
        Now you should be able to ping the desktop from the Z, try in console on Z:
        ping 192.168.129.200

        Now you will get a network connection automatically, 
        if you connect your Z to the desktop via the USB cable.


In the following, we assume, that 
the desktop has the IP address:  192.168.129.200
and that 
the Z has the IP address:  192.168.129.201
        
*****************************************************
4) Configuring KA/Pi+KO/Pi on Z for Sync
*****************************************************

Start KO/Pi on the Z.
Choose Menu: Synchronize - Configure
Fill in name for "Local device name:", e.g. "Z760"
Click on "New profile"
Set name of "Profile:", e.g. "BUG".
(that is the above name of the desktop computer)
Choose "Profile kind": Pi-Sync.
Set "Password for remote access", e.g. "xyz" for
Calendar and Addressbook.
Set Remote IP address to 192.168.129.200 for
Calendar and Addressbook.
(Note: That is the IP address of the desktop!).
The "Remote port number" is 9197/9198  for
Calendar and Addressbook.
You do not have to change the
"Remote port number" or any other settings.
Click "OK" button to save your settings.

Now you have configured KA/Pi+KO/Pi sync on the Z,
no need to configure anything in KA/Pi.


*****************************************************
5) Enable remote sync in KA/Pi+KO/Pi on the desktop
*****************************************************

Start KO/Pi on the desktop.
Do a "test" sync with KDE, choose menu:
Synchronize - KDE_Desktop
After syncing, you should have the same data in KDE
and in KO/Pi.
NOTE:
The KO/Pi version 1.9.10 had the bug, that on the first
sync with KDE, all data in KDE was deleted.
DO NOT USE VERSION 1.9.10!

The bevaviour on the first sync is
(in versions >= 1.9.11)
that no data is deleted, the data in KO/Pi and in 
KDE is merged into one calendar.

When the first sync was ok, please choose menu:
Synchronize - Enable Pi-sync
Fill in the values for port ("9197" in our examle) 
and for the password ( "xyz" in our example)
that you did configure on the Z for that computer.
Enable "Automatically start at application start"
and "Automatically sync with KDE-Desktop when receiving sync request"
by checking the two boxes.
Close KO/Pi.

Configure / test KA/Pi on the desktop in the same way.
Fill in the right value for the port (9198 in our examle)
in KA/Pi! 

*****************************************************
6) Sync
*****************************************************

After configuring everything as above, you have to do
the following, if you want to sync your Zaurus with KDE:
(It syncs will all resources in KDE, that are not "readonly").

Start KO/Pi on the desktop.
If Kontact or KOrganizer is running, save the calendar!
Connect the Z with the USB cable to your desktop.
(Or to the local network).
Choose on the Z the menu:
Syncronize - <your name for the desktop sync profile>
( that was "BUG" in our example ).
That's all.

Do the same with KA/Pi.

NOTE:
If an appointment/addressee is created on the Z, it is added to the
standard resource in KDE.

If you have todos with subtodos in your calendar, you will get on
every sync (after you restartet KOrganizer or Kontact in KDE)
the message "xx items changed on local", where
xx is greater or equal to the number of todos.
That behaviour is caused by a bug in KDE.
(In KDE, everytime a subtodo is loaded, 
it's "last modified" settings are set to the current time - ouch!)
I hope I can fix this bug in KDE soon.
