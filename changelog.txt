Info about the changes in new versions of KDE-Pim/Pi

********** VERSION 2.2.0 ************

New stable release!
Fixed some minor usability problems.
Added writing of next alarm to a file for usage on pdaXrom.

********** VERSION 2.1.19 ************

Fixed a crash in journal view.
Fixed a crash at setting a todo to stopped if KO/Pi saved the file while "stop todo" dialog was shown.
Fixed a minor problem with the marcus bains line (whatever that is).
Fixed a crash when setting a todo to complete from the show dialog which was called from the What's Next View.

********** VERSION 2.1.18 ************

Pi-Sync mode:
The "Write back file" status dialog was updated too often such that writing back the file on the Z was very slow. Fixed.

KO/Pi:
Fixed a layout problem on the Z 5500 with the calender box right of the location box in the event/todo editor. Thanks to Andrew, who found, reported and fixed this problem ( I did not get that problem - it was working on my 5500 ).

Fixed a problem when (imported or added from other applications) events or todos did have attachments.
Fixed a really ugly and hidden problem in the management of the parent/child relationchip of todos.


********** VERSION 2.1.17 ************

KO/Pi:
Added option to display times in What's Next View on two lines.
(Useful for display on the Zaurus with 240x320 screen)
Removed "Allday" for allday events of one day duration in What's Next View.
Added date range for allday events of more than one day duration in What's Next View.
Fixed two problems in the data importing from Outlook:
  Fixed the duplicated import if the summary, location or description had whitespaces at the end.
  Fixed a problem importing certain recurrence rules.  

A journal in an ics file may have no dtStart value (as files from KNotes, which stores its notes in an ics journal file).
If now a journal has no dtStart value the dtStart value is set to the created value of the journal when loading the file. That makes it possible to view and edit "notes" from KNotes. Simply add another Resource in KO/Pi which is a copy of the ics file from KNotes. You will find the "notes" in KO/Pi as a journal entry on the date you created it.

And some minor fixes in KO/Pi.


********** VERSION 2.1.16 ************

Fixed a problem with the menu bar in KO/Pi and using the "Menu" hardware key on the Zaurus.
Added columns for datetime in todo view: Last modified, created and last modified subtodo
Fixed a bug in agenda view displaying recurring multiday events which are longer than two days.
Made conflict detection up to 4 times faster.

********** VERSION 2.1.15 ************

Fixed two layout problems on the Z:
Made the with of the newly added buttons on the Quick-Todo smaller.
Made listweek layout in 2 columns on the Z760 in portait screen and full menubar visible.


********** VERSION 2.1.14 ************

Added some buttons to the KO/Pi Quick-todo line to make it possible to quickly access some todo view layout settings like display all flat/open/close and hide/show running/done.
Added a button to add a subtodo quickly.

Added a possibility to search for conflicting events. (In the Action menu. Keyboard shortcut "q", shift+q or ctrl +q ).
Added an option to change the layout of the list week to column mode.

Fixed some usability problems in pi-sync mode by adding some progress information about file transfer.

Fixed pi-sync problems with the new multi calendar feature.
Now pi-sync behaviour should be:
1) Local sends file request ( as usual )
2) Remote sends file which contains data of all enabled ( the calendar where the "eye" column is checked ) calendars.
3) Local syncs with data, adds new entries to default calendar and sends file back ( as usual ).
   If the data which local receives contains entries which are on disabled calendars on local this entries are updated and not added as duplicates to the default calendar.
4) Remote updates the data and adds new entries to default calendar. Readonly entries are not changed on remote.
   If the data which remote receives contains entries which are on disabled calendars on remote this entries are updated and not added as duplicates to the default calendar.

Summary: 
No new item ( new created after the last sync ) in a disabled calendar is propagated to the sync partner. Readonly items are synced and added/changed on the sync partner if it is not readonly on the sync partner.
If you have different calendars on remote and local and some of them disabled you may get some "strange" bahaviour.
Well, the syncing has become quite complicated ... you should have no problems if you enable all calendars. 

********** VERSION 2.1.13 ************

Fixed a problem in KA/Pi search.
Fixed some minor problems in KO/Pi.
Added calendar selection possibility to the todo view popup and to the event/todo/journal editor.

Fixed memory usage problems in KA/Pi:
When loading data KA/Pi did load the file data twice.
Example:
  A 600k file did consume 1200k memory during loading process.
  This is fixed, it does now consume only  600k during loading process.
When saving data KA/Pi did consume a lot of memory for the data parsing during the save process.
This is fixed.
Example:
  Before saving a 600k file KA/Pi did consume 21.7 Meg of Ram.
  When saving  KA/Pi did consume 28.6 Meg of Ram. That causes a crash on the Zaurus because there was no memeory left in the system.
  Now  KA/Pi is consuming on saving the same data 22.0 Meg of Ram during the save process. 
Note: The memory usage of KA/Pi after the data is loaded/saved has not changed.
The saving of data may be a bit slower now.

Fixed memory usage problems in KO/Pi:
When KO/Pi did save the data to file, it did not release the used buffers after saving.
The used buffer was released after saving the next time, but there was new buffer space allocated again on that save operation.
This is fixed.
Example:
  When saving a 400k file KO/Pi do now use 400k less memory now.

Optimized memory usage in KO/Pi Agenda view:
KO/Pi is storing some paint information in extra buffers for faster repainting of the agenda view.
These buffers were not made smaller (i.e. downsized)  because of performance reasons.
The handling of these buffers are now much smarter:
Two (of six) buffers are removed completely.
The remaing four buffers are now downsized after not using the agenda view for 45 seconds.
Such that the memory usage of KO/Pi is smaller now in general ( because 2 buffers are removed) and is much smaller when not using the agenda view. That is very important when using fastload for KO/Pi.

Worst case example ( for a maximum size agenda content):
  When resizing the agenda content to a large scale, KO/Pi did use 17Meg of mem ( and did not use less memory until it was stopped). Now KO/Pi is using on the same operation only 14.3 Meg of mem and after 45 seconds not using the agenda view it uses only 9.4 Meg of mem.

When switching to an unused Agenda view now KO/Pi is upizing the buffers again. This takes less than a second. Such that switching to Agenda view (after not using it for more than 45 seconds) is now a bit slower. 

Summary:
Many memory wasting problems of KA/Pi and KO/Pi fixed such that it is better to use on the Zaurus.

********** VERSION 2.1.12 ************

KO/Pi:
Many small usability fixes, e.g. rearranged the popup menus such that they are better to use on the Zaurus.
Fixed a problem with the month view when file was saved but KO/Pi was not the active window.
Fixed some problems in the resource config dialog (e.g. added a warning if you set all calendars to read-only).
Fixed some other small problems.

********** VERSION 2.1.11 ************

KO/Pi:
Because we can have many calendars now in KO/Pi we can have more than one journal entry per day.
Added features to handle (and add ) more than one journal entry per day.
Added option for a journal title.

Added info about the calendar, the item belongs to, to the event/todo/journal viewer. 
Fixed a problem of the alarm of completed recurring todos.
Added to the event/todo editor to set quickly the category of an item.


Fixed some problems when calling KO/Pi or KA/Pi from the alarm applet.

Added KA/Pi multi sync to the multi sync called from the alarm applet.
 
********** VERSION 2.1.10 ************

KO/Pi:
Importing Birthdays will now create another file resource "Birthdays" and import the birthday data from KA/Pi into that file.
When a multidayevent is selected in monthview all occurences of this event in the monthview are now hightlighted.
Fixed a bug in searching for a small timerange, i.e. one day.

KA/Pi:
Fixed two problems in csv export.
Fixed problems when calling the contact selection dialog from KO/Pi or OM/Pi.

********** VERSION 2.1.9 ************

KO/Pi:
Fixed some problems of the new search options in the search dialog.
Fixed some problems in the new resource config options.
Changed the recurrence edit of events and todos such that the recurrence edit page now is notified about a change of the start date on the first page.
Fixed a problem creating new events in the agenda view if at the day/time is already an agenda item shown:
Now you can click on the bottom/top of an allday agenda item or on the left/right side of an agenda item to get the "new todo/new event" popup.

Fixed a problem in recurrence range in syncing with DTM.

KA/Pi:
Made it posiible to show in the contact overview the details of all data available for that contact( e.g. office, spouse, children, nickname ...)

PwM/Pi:
Added "sec" to the timeout config settings to make it clear the timeout values are seconds.

********** VERSION 2.1.8 ************

KO/Pi:
Added info about the completion state of a todo in the ListView/Searchdialog.
If in TodoView is selected "do not show compledted todos" then completed todos are not shown in the ListView as well.
Fixed some updating problems when changing the filter.

KA/Pi:
In the addressee selection dialog now the formatted name is shown, if not empty.
Added a column "category" to the addressee selection dialog to make it possible to sort addressees after category.
Now in the addressee selection dialog a selected contact is remove with a single click from the selected list.

Fixed in the file selector on the Zaurus the problem that symbolic links to files/dirs were ignored.
Fixed the sorting for size in the file selector on the Z.

Changed the color selection dialog on the Zaurus to a more user friendly version.

********** VERSION 2.1.7 ************

KO/Pi:

Added more options to the search dialog. 
Fixed a problem in the Month view.  
Added more options to the dialog when setting a todo to stopped.

KO/Pi:
Added to the list view (the list view is used in search dialog as well) the possibility to print it.
Added to the list view the possibility to hide entries, if you do not want to print all entries of the list view.
Added to the list view the possibility to add all subtodos of selected todos to an export/beam.
Added to the search dialog the possibility to make an additive search such that you can get a better list for export/printout.
Added to the search dialog the possibility to hide the checkboxes such that there is more space for the list view on the Zaurus.
Fixed a problem in the AlarmTimer Applet: Now utf8 messages are displayed properly.

Added support for multiple calendar files in KO/Pi. Only local ical (*.ics) files are supported as calendars.
In the sync profile config it is still missing to specify a particular calendar to sync with this profile. That setting will be added later.
Now on every sync the set of calendars is synced which are enabled in the resource view. 

A calendar is enabled in the resource view if the "eye" column is checked. 
You can set a calendar to be the default for new items( "+" column ).
You can tell KO/Pi to ignore all alarm of a calendar ( "bell" column ) and you can set it readonly.
To find out how to add a new calendar and how to remove a calendar is left as an exercise to the reader ...


********** VERSION 2.1.5 ************

This is the new stable version.
Bugfix:
Fixed a problem with agenda popup on the desktop in KO/Pi.
Fixed a crash when reloading file, e.g. after a passive pi-sync synchronization.
Added config option to not display completed todos in agenda view.

Added Backup options to global config:
You can create now x-daily backups for KO/Pi, KA/Pi (for file resources only, file resource is the standard type) and PwM/Pi ( all files you will open ). 
It is recommended to use another HDD/Memory card for the backup directory. If (very useful on the Zaurus) the specified backup directory does not exist you are asked if you want to try again to create a backup. That makes it possible to insert your memory card in the Zaurus and then trying again.
The backup is created when the application wants to save for the first time on a backup-day. You can specify the amount of backups and the day interval of backups.

More bugfixes.
Added possibility to clone in KO/Pi a todo with all its subtodos.
Added config option for alternate background in list views.

Added a timetracker funtionality in KO/Pi for todos in the todo view.
If a todo is set to started and then to stopped it is saving information about the runtime in
<yourhome>/kdepim/apps/timetrackerdir.
To read, display, print this information an external program is needed which will be developed.
It will display the data in a Gantt timetable view with one row for each todo.
It will have many possibilities sorting the data after category, parent todos, attendees, ... and for creating/printing status reports/summaries.
Merging of data from different computers/users will be quite easy because every run is stored in a single file.

********** VERSION 2.0.26 ************

Added two more fields to the KA/Pi view config:
A "Mobile (home)" and a "Mobile (work)" field.
Fixed utf8 import (e.g. for Japaneese text) in KA/Pi.

And again fixed some bugs.

********** VERSION 2.0.24 ************

Fixed again a lot of small bugs.

Month view displays now multi days events on top of each cell, such that it is more likely that all multi days items of one event are in the same row.

********** VERSION 2.0.23 ************

Fixed again a lot of small and strange  bugs, e.g. the missing toolbar of KA/Pi after a new installation.
Fixed the (agenda) layout of KO/Pi on 5500er.
Some usebility enhancements (e.g. reselection the current item of the todo view after some changes).

********** VERSION 2.0.22 ************

KO/Pi:
Fix for creating events/todos via the abgenda context menu.
Added option to split toolbar to 3 toolbars.
(Toolbar moving s disabled for this option due to a bug in Qt somewhere).

Fixed the annoying problem that scrolling continued after the key was released in KO/Pi Monthview and the KA/Pi views.

And, this is a really cool option (Ben did suggest it):
Now KO/Pi and KA/Pi can be run from a USB stick:
All data is read from and written to the stick.
You can enable this in the global configure option TAB with:
Save using LOCAL storage.
Just put KDE-Pim/Pi on a memory stick and you can access all your PIM data on every computer with Windows XP. It will work with the ME and Linux versions as well. I will put a memory stick version for teh next stable release online.

Pressing the "Calendar" button on the Z switches now to the next view in KO/Pi.
The set of possible "next views" are the views you have toolbar buttons for.

Made alarm sound working on Linux.

KO/Pi alarm applet changed:
Made buttons in alarm dialog much bigger.
Made setting of timer more user friendly by showing the actual timer fire time and making the buttons in the timer settings much bigger.
The goal was it to make it possible to use a finger tip  ( and not the stylus ) on the touchscreen to adjust the settings.

And because this version is realeased at Easter, I added an Easter-egg:
With a new undocumented command you can get a message box about the next alarm.
Good luck to find it!

E.g. to search for all contact beginning with b to n, type 
b-n
in the search field.

********** VERSION 1.9.20 ************

KO/Pi:
Added for the "dislplay one day" agenda mode 
info in the caption and in the day lables:

dates of the prev./next month with the mouse.

OM/Pi:
"Delete mail" icon in main window now deletes all selected mails.
Fixed the problem, that the state flag of imap mails was ignored.
Now mails with "FLAG_SEEN" on the imap server get no icon in the list view
to indecate that they are already seen.
Fixed the problem that the body of some mails was not displayed in the
mail viewer when fetching them from the imap server directly to read them.

********** VERSION 1.9.18 ************

FYI: The VERSION 1.9.17 was a testing release only.
Please read the changelog of VERSION 1.9.17 as well.

Cleaned up the syncing config dialog.
Added sync config options for date range for events.
Added sync config options for filters on incoming data.
Added sync config options for filters on outgoing data.
Please read the updated SyncHowTo about the new filter settings.
These filter settings make it now possible to sync with shared
calendars without writing back private or confidential data
(via the outgoing filters).
To sync only with particular parts of a shared calendar, 
the incoming filter settings can be used.
An example can be found in the SyncHowTo.
Same for shared addressbooks.

Added a setting for the global kdepim data storage.
Usually the data is stored in (yourhomedir/kdepim).
Now you can set in the Global config dialog TAB, subTAB "Data storage path"
a directory where all the kdepim data is stored.
That makes it easy to save all kdepim data on a SD card on the Z, for example.

KO/Pi:
The timeedit input has a pulldown list for times.
If opened, this pulldown list should now has the right time highlighted.
Added the possibility to exclude events/todos/journals in a filter.
You should exclude journals, if you do not want them to sync with a  public calendar.

KA/Pi:
Added the possibility to in/exclude public/private/confidential contacts to a filter.
If you have already defined filterrules in KA/Pi you have to adjust them all by setting the "include public/private/confidential" property manually. Sorry for that ...
Added printing of card view and details view on desktop.
Printing of list view is not working...
Added button for removing pictures in contact editor.
Parsing data fix of KA/Pi version 1.9.17.
Fixed the "parse name automatically" problem of KA/Pi version 1.9.17.

KO/Pi:
Fixed that tooltips were not updated after moving an item in agenda view.
Fixed a bug in sorting start date for recurring events in list view.
Changed the left button in todo viewer from "Agenda" to "Set completed".
This makes it possible to change a todo in the What's Next View quickly to the completed state without leaving the What's Next View.
Added more info in the todo viewer: Startdate, parent/sub todos.
 

KA/Pi:
All fields search does now actually search all the (possible) fields, 
not only those listed in the contact list.
Made is possible to inline a picture in a vcard on the Z.
This was only possible on the desktop, now is it possible on the Z as well.
Fixed of missing save settings after filter configuration.
Made saving of addressbook much faster.
Fixed extension widget layout problem.
Fixed saving of default formatted name settings.
Fixed formatted name handling in edit dialog.
Added an option for changing formatted names of many contacts
(menu: File - Change - Set formatted name).

QWhatsThis was not working on the Z ( only black rectangle was shown).
This is Fixed.

KDE-Sync:
Now readonly KDE resources are synced as well.
(They are not changed in KDE itself, of course).

 

********** VERSION 1.9.16 ************

KO/Pi:
Fixed search dialog size on Z 6000 (480x640 display).
Added setting to hide/show time in agenda items.
Added setting to hide not running todos in todo view.
Added columns for start date/time in todo view.
Replaced the solid half-hour lines in agenda view by dot lines.

(i.e. Windows and Linux).
Fixed a crash in KO/Pi when starting KO/Pi with What's Next view.
Added tooltips in month view.(Tooltips only available on desktop)

Fixed a strange problem in KO/Pi alarm applet.
Did not find the actual problem, 
such that now Qtopia reboots again if deinstalling the alarm applet.
But the alarm applet should work again.

KA/Pi:
Fixed the problem, that internal pictures were not saved.

Fixed a problem in the pi-sync mode by increasing the timeout for data transfer from 20 seconds to 5 minutes.

Fixed some minor problems. (Like word wrap in help text windows).

Fixed a compiling problem in microkde/kresources.

KO/Pi is using zdbat (renamed to db2file) for syncing with Sharp DTM.
This version now includes zdbat 1.0.0 (old version was zdbat 0.2.9)
such that now syncing KO/Pi with Sharp DTM should work on the 
Zaurus C 3000 model.

********** VERSION 1.9.15 ************

Usebilty enhancements in KO/Pi:
When clicking on the date in a month view cell, the day view is shown.
Old behaviour was, that the "new event" dialog popped up.

Added a one step "undo delete" in KO/Pi (Accessable in the "Action" menu). 
That means, you can restore the latest
event/todo/journal you have deleted.
A journal is deleted, if you clear all the text of the journal.

Fixed the bug of the editor dialogs in KO/Pi of version 1.9.14.

KA/Pi  starting in 480x640 resolution:
Hide the filter action in toolbar
and added icons for undo/delete/redo in toolbar.

Change in OM/Pi ViewMail dialog:
When clicking on the "delete" icon the mail is deleted after confirmation as usual. 
But the edit dialog is not closed as before, now the next mail in the folder is shown automatically (if there is any).

Fixed a crash when deleting mail-accounts in OM/Pi.


********** VERSION 1.9.14 ************

Fixed some problems with the dialog sizes when switching 
portrait/landscape mode on 640x480 PDA display.

Fixed some other small bugs in KA/Pi KO/Pi and OM/Pi and PwM/Pi.

Fixed an ugly bug in KOpieMail: 
KOpieMail was not able to write files (mails) to MSDOS file system, 
like on an usual preformatted SD card. That should work now.
To save your mail data on the Sd card do the following:
Create a dir on the SD card:
mkdir /mnt/card/localmail
Go to your home dir:
cd
Go to kopiemail data storage dir:
cd kdepim/apps/kopiemail
Create a symlink to the SD card:
ls -s /mnt/card/localmail
Now KOpieMail will store all mails on the SD card.

KO/Pi Monthview:
Now "Go to Today" selects the current month from day 1-end,
not the current date + some days.
I.e. "Go to Today" shows now always
the current month with first day of month in the first row. 

Added missing German translation.

Fixed icons of executeable on Wintendo.

Added a "Show next Mail" button to the OM/Pi 
mail viewer such that the mail below the current mail
in the mail list view of the current folder
can be read with a single click.

Fixed nasty PwM/Pi file reading bug, when
the used hash algo of file is different then the global 
hash algo.

Added KA/Pi support for opie mailit mailapplication.

Fixed some bugs in OM/Pi.
Now character conversion tables are available for the Zaurus
to make OM/Pi working properly.
To get the character conversion in OM/Pi working, please download
at the sourceforge project site the package
sr-character-conversion_SharpROM_arm.ipk.zip
(or oz-character-conversion_OZ-gcc3xx_arm.ipk.zip for OZ roms)
from the section "general files for KDE/Pim"
Instructions how to install this package are in a ReadMe in this file.


Fixed the orientation change problem in KA/Pi when switching
portrait/landscape mode.

when closing the app.
And PwM/Pi handles now different texts for the
fields Description, Username, Password, configurable per category.

Fixed a crash in KO/Pi , when importing/loading vcs files
which have an entry with an attendee with state:
NEEDS ACTION

Fixed some problems in the German translation of OM/Pi,
which makes some dialogs not fitting on the screen
of the Z 5500.

Fixed Qtopia crash, when disabling/deinstalling
KO/Pi alarm applet.

Implemented direct KDE<->KA/Pi sync for KA/Pi running 
on Linux desktop.

Added feature "remove sync info" to sync menu.

Tweaked the KO/Pi What's next view a bit, added
setting to hide events that are done.

Disabled "beam receive enabled" on startup to 
avoid problems if Fastload is enabled.
Please set "beam receive enabled",
if you want to receive data via IR.

Fixed bug in  direct KDE<->KO/Pi sync for KO/Pi running 
on Linux desktop.

Made in KA/Pi scrolling possible, if details view is selected.
(The keyboard focus is set automatically to the search line)

Fixed a bug in DMT sync, that a new entry in DTM was added 
on every sync to Kx/Pi.

Fixed missing writing of KA/Pi categories to DMT entries when syncing.

Fixed a bug in DMT sync with todos created in KO/Pi containing
non-latin1 characters.

Rearranged package contents of Sharp-ipks and made all

Possible to configure a view to display categories.

Added detailed "KDE Sync Howto" and "Multi Sync Howto" to Help menu.

Fixed displaying of "free" days and time in KO Monthview and Agendaview.

... and many other bugfixes.

********** VERSION 1.9.10 ************

Many internal small bugfixes.
And fix of the "big" bug in KO/Pi, 
that after Syncing the appointments had an offset by several hours.
That was a problem with the internal timezone setting,
introduced by the changed timezone configuration settings.

German translation for OM/Pi is now available.


********** VERSION 1.9.9 ************

KDE-Pim/Pi has a new Member!
It is called PWM/Pi (Passwordmanager/platform-independent) 
and it is available for the Zaurus.
It is planned, that it will be available later for Windows.
(And for Linux, of course).
It is a port of the Passwordmanager of KDE.
It will need the MicroKDElibs to run.

Made loading of addressbooks in KA/Pi up to 7 times faster!
The bigger your addressbook file, the more starting speed 
will you gain. (relatively)

The Qtopia addressbook connector is now platform independend
as well and should work on any platform for importing/exporting
Qtopia and Opie XML files.

Added a +30min feature to the timezone settings to make 
KDE-Pim/Pi useable in Australia and other parts on the 
world with strange timezones ;-)

German "Umlaute" should now be sorted correctly on the Z in KA/Pi.

It is now possible to disable the
"receive data via infrared" feature, such that syncing with
Outlook is now possible again with Kx/Pi runing.
Please disable it, before syncing Sharp DTM with Outlook.
For your convenience, the "receive data via infrared" feature
is disabled automatically, if you sync Kx/Pi with DTM.
You have to enable it again manually after syncing.
Enabling this feature makes it impossible to start the
Sharp DTM apps. If this feature is enabled, you will only get the 
alarm notification from KO/Pi and not from the Sharp calendar.
This is very useful if you sync KO/Pi with Sharp DTM,
because after syncing you usually would get notified about
an alarm by KO/Pi and the Sharp Calendar.

Together with the Linux desktop version of KO/Pi
it is now possible to sync KO/Pi on the Zaurus
with the complete KDE-desktop (3.3 or later)
calendar data easily.
That makes it possible to sync the Z with one 
click of a mouse with the KDE-Desktop.
This feature it available for all Zaurus platforms KO/Pi
is running on.
The only thing needed is a running KO/Pi on Linux and
a compiled version of the small 
KDE-Pim/Pi<->KDE-Desktop access command line program, 
which is in the KDE-Pim/Pi sources available.

The "KDE-desktop" syncing feature for KA/Pi will follow
in the next releases.

Fixed the vcard export bug, which had the version 1.9.8.

Added missing GERMAN translation to KO/Pi.
Hi PsionX, could you add the missing french translation?Thx!

Translation files for KA/Pi are available as well.
GERMAN translation will be available in the next release.
PsionX ( yres, you again ;-) ), could you start translating
KA/Pi? Thx!

You can download the version 1.9.9 at

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104103&package_id=112604

Note:
To run the mail program OM/Pi you need libopenssl.
A link to a download loaction is available at
ZSI at www.killefiz.de


********** VERSION 1.9.8 ************

Fixed character decoding in OM/Pi.
(e.g. German "Umlaute" were not displayed properly.)

Made is possible to reparent todos in KO/Pi.
Use contextmenu or keys (look at Help-Keys + Colors) for that.

Added the missing Sync-Howto and WhatsNew to the packages.

KO/Pi on Linux desktop can now sync with KDE desktop.
That means: When using KO/Pi on Linux desktop for syncing with
KDE desktop and the Zaurus, the Zaurus can be synced now
with all KDE-Calendar resources, not only with one local file.
(That makes it possible to sync the Zaurus with the 
calendar data on a Kolab server) 

KA/Pi syncing with KDE desktop will be available in the next version.


********** VERSION 1.9.7 ************

KO/Pi - KA/Pi on Windows:
Now a directory can be defined by the user, where the 
application/config data should be saved.
  Define your desired path in the evironment variable
  MICROKDEHOME
  before starting KO/Pi or KA/Pi.

An easy Kx/Pi to Kx/Pi syncing is now possible 
(it is called Pi-Sync) via network.
Please look at the Sync Howto.

Exporting of calendar data and contacts to mobile phones is now possible.
The SyncHowto is updated with information howto
access/sync mobile phones. 
Please look at the Sync Howto.

Now KO/Pi and KA/Pi on the Zaurus can receive data via infrared directly.
Please disable Fastload for the original contact/calendar applications
and close them.
KO/Pi and KA/Pi must be running in order to receive the data.
(KO/Pi and KA/Pi are always running if Fastload for them is enabled!)

In the KA/Pi details view are now the preferred tel. numbers displayed on top 
of the other data ( emails/tel.numbers/addresses)

Fixed some syncing problems in KA/Pi.

Added font settings for the KA/Pi details view.
Added fields "children's name" and "gender" to KA/Pi.

Made searching in KA/Pi better:
Now the first item in a view is selected after a search automatically and
the views can be scrolled up/down when the search input field has the keyboard focus.

And, of course, fixed a bunch of reported bugs in KO/Pi and KA/Pi.


********** VERSION 1.9.6 ************

Changes in the external application communication on the Zaurus 
in order to use less RAM when the apps are running.
First syncing of addressbooks (KA/Pi) is possible.


********** VERSION 1.9.5a ************

Fixed a bug in KO/Pi in the SharpDTM sync of version 1.9.5.
Fixed some small bugs.
KA/Pi shows now the birthday in summary view.
Now OM/Pi and KA/Pi are using the date format defined in KO/Pi
for displaying dates.


********** VERSION 1.9.5 ************

There is still no Addressbook syncing!

New in 1.9.5:

Many bugfixes.
Better searching in KA/Pi.
You can configure in KA/Pi if you want to search only after 
<return> key pressed.

Better mail downloading in OM/Pi.

First experimental alpha version of sync of KO/Pi with mobile phones.
See gammu documentation for supported phones.
You need to install the package kammu_1.9.5_arm.ipk for sync of KO/Pi with mobile phones. kammu_1.9.5_arm.ipk needs libbluetooth and libsdp.
Quick hint how to use:
NOTE: MOBILE PHONE SYNC IS EXPERIMENTAL!
Install kammu_1.9.5_arm.ipk , libbluetooth and libsdp.
Create syncprofile - mobile device
Remove entry for model. (Leave empty ).
Enable infrared on Zaurus and your Phone.
Sync.
To get a more detailed log, start kopi from konsole.

********** VERSION 1.9.4 ************

This is the version 1.9.4 of KDE-Pim/Pi for the Zaurus.

WARNING:
PLEASE BACKUP ALL YOUR DATA!
We have changed a lot and maybe there are some unknown problems.

SYNC HANDLING HAS CHANGED!
Such that, if you sync now with an already synded device, you will duplicated entries after the first sync.
(This change was introduced to make it possible to sync with mobile phones, which will be available later (maybe in 4 weeks).

You need the kmicrokdelibs_1.9.4_arm.ipk as a base for the other programs.
If you get the error: "Install only possible in main memory", just try it again to install it on SD card. That worked for me. And it was reported that rebooting Qtopia did help in this case as well. 

As programs are available:
KO/Pi (korganizer ipk) - a calendar program.
KA/Pi (kaddressbook ipk ) - an addressbook
OM/Pi (kopiemail ipk ) an email program with pop/smtp and IMAP support.

An alarm notification program ( korganizer-alarm ipk ) for KO/Pi that notifies you about alarms, even if the Zaurus is in suspend mode.
(If you do not see an icon in the taskbar after installing korganizer-alarm, please restart Qtopia)

All the applications are installed in a "Pim" TAB.
If this TAB is new on your system, you can get an icon in this TAB by installing pim_TAB_icon_1.9.4_arm.ipk

All the application are integrated.
Such that you can choose in KO/Pi the attendees of a  meeting from the addresses in KA/Pi. When you click in KA/Pi on the email address, OM/Pi is started to write the mail.

HINT:
If you install KPhone/Pi 0.9.7, it will be called, if you click in KA/Pi on a phone number.

What's new?

SYNC HANDLING HAS CHANGED!
Such that, if you sync now with an already synded device, you will duplicated entries after the first sync.
(This change was introduced to make it possible to sync with mobile phones, which will be available later (maybe in 4 weeks).

New in OM/Pi:
When copying(i.e. downloading mails) , you can specify, that only mails of a given size should be downloaded. Added mail copy possibility for selected mails.

New in KO/Pi:
French is now available for KO/Pi.
Choose menu:Actions - Configure:TAB locale
Syncing has changed.
Phone sync available soon.
Not much changes, I cannot remember them ...

New in KA/Pi:
Beaming possible.
Sharp DTM readonly access possible( create a new DTM resource );
Better searching possible.
Search is performed only after pressing the return key.
Use wildcard * to specify parts of a name.

Better name/email selection dialog (called from KO/Pi or OM/Pi). In this dialog, now searching is possible. Like in KA/Pi, use return key and wildcard * .

A big improvement is the new management of the contact access.
In version 1.9.3, every application was using their own addressbook access data.
That means, the addressbook was loaded up to three times in the memory, when accessed by  KA/Pi, KO/Pi and OM/Pi.
That was wasting of memory, if you had several hundreds of contacts.

Now only KA/Pi accesses the addressbook.
If KO/Pi or OM/Pi want to get some name/email data, they request KA/Pi to open the  name/email selection dialog and send it back to them.
If you click on an attendee in a meeting, its contact data is displayed in KA/Pi directly.
That means, if KO/Pi or OM/Pi want to access contact data, KA/Pi is started first.

New in the KO/Pi alarm applet:
Configure your own timer popup menu!
(Text and minutes for timer countdown)
Just edit the file
(yourhomedir)/.kopialarmtimerrc
and start/stop a timer to get a new menu with the data of this file.

********** VERSION 1.9.3 ************
1)
Now KO/Pi on Windows imports directly the calendar data of
an installed Outlook. Should work with OL version >= 2000.
 
********** VERSION 1.9.2 ************
1)
KDE-Pim/Pi has got a new member:
KmicroMail (KM/Pi) is a mail program, 
which can handle IMAP and POP mail access.
It is based on Opie-Mail v3.
All dependencies to the Opie libraries ar removed, 
such that no additional Opie lib is needed.
It is already integrated in KO/Pi and KA/Pi.
It it now available for the Zaurus,probably it 
will be available for other platforms later.
Hint:
Create your own contact (name + email)
in KA/Pi, select this contact and choose menu:
Settings - Set Who Am I.
Now the settings of this contact are used as 
the sender data in KM/Pi.
2)
KDE-Pim/Pi is split up in five different
packages now precompiled for Sharp Zaurus:
--kmicrokdelibs_1.9.2_arm.ipk
The libs are needed for any 
of the following programs:
--kaddressbook_1.9.2_arm.ipk
--kmicromail_1.9.2_arm.ipk
--korganizer_1.9.2_arm.ipk
Independ from that, there is the alarm applet
available for KO/Pi, which also offers
quick access for a new mail or
showing the addressbook.:
--korganizer-alarm_1.9.2_arm.ipk
Independend means, that the alarm applet
does not need any of the libs or programs above to run.
But it would be quite useless without these programs.
NOTE:
If you get a
"This application depends on other programs"
during installation of 
--kmicrokdelibs_1.9.2_arm.ipk
you probably do not have to care about that.
kmicrokdelibs_1.9.2 will come with some
resource plugins, which needs additional libraries.
(E.g. libopie1, if you want to use the 
opie resource connector in KA/Pi).
If you do not have this libraries installed,
you simply cannot use the resource.
To make it clear:
If the libraries are missing, the applications
using kmicrokdelibs will start, 
because the resources are plugins.
3)
KO/Pi and friends are now installable on SD-Card!
It is recommended to install all libs and apps
on the SD card or all in the internal storage.
There may be problems, if this is mixed.
4)
Fixed two bugs in the alarm notification on Windows.
5)
Great improvement!
KO/Pi uses now the latest version of libical.
Libical is the library which actually reads 
the calendar files and extract the data from it.
With the old version, there were problems
(crashes or program hangs) when licical did read
files, which were not stored from KO/Pi.
I do not know, if the new libical works perfect,
but actually it works much better than
the old version.
There are no problems with compatibility with 
old calendar files of KO/Pi, of course!
6)
New in KA/Pi:
Opie addressbook resource connector available!
You will need libopie1 and the opie addressbook,
of course.
With the Opie addressbook resource connector,
you can access the Opie addressbook readonly in KA/Pi.
If you want to edit or import the data into KA/Pi,
do this:
a) Create an Opie resource.
   (Menu: Settings-Configure Resources).
After configuration and restarting KA/Pi you should see
the Opie contacts in KA/Pi.
b) Select some or all Opie contacts.
(NOTE: +++++
To know exactly, what contacts are Opie contacts, 
do this: Choose menu: 
View-Modify View - TAB Fields.
Select in the above list "Resource" and click
down arrow to add it to the "Selected fields".
Click OK.
Now you have a new column "Resource" in your list,
where you can see, what an Opie resource is.
++++ NOTE end.)
Ok, we do have now some Opie contacts seleted.
(Use SHIFT or CTRL key in order to multiple select).
c) Choose menu: Edit-Copy.
d) Choose menu: Edit-Paste.
e) Select the resource, you want to add the contacts to.
Congrats! Now you have read/write access to the copied 
opie contacts as "real" KA/Pi contacts.


********** VERSION 1.9.1 ************
1)
       +++ IMPORTANT 1 +++

The storing place of the default calendar 
file has changed!
The default calendar file was
Applications/korganizer/mycalendar.ics 
on Zaurus and 
(yourHomeDir)/korganizer/mycalendar.ics 
on Windows/Linux desktop. Now it is
(yourHomeDir)/kdepim/korganizer/mycalendar.ics
on Zaurus, Windows and Linux.
To load the old file, choose menu
File-Load calendar backup.
(It should be loaded automatically
at startup with a warning message displayed).
The place of the configuration file has changed too.
If you want to use your old KO/Pi config,
copy it to 
(yourHomeDir)/kdepim/config/korganizerrc
Please read VERSION 1.9.0 - topic 3) as well!

       +++ IMPORTANT 2 +++

Because of the new paths, you will need
a new version of the KO/Pi alarm applet
for Zaurus.
Use version >= 1.9.1

2)
Now the QWhat'sThis Icon works for items
in the month view as well.
(See VERSION 1.7.8 Topic 1) ).
3)
You can import birtsdays/anniversaries
from KA/Pi into KO/Pi.
Choose menu File-Import birthdays.
If you import twice, already imported items
will not be imported again, if they 
have not been changed in KO/Pi.
4)
When syncing with sharp DTM, now a progress 
is shown, when the data is written back.
If there is much data in KO/Pi and no data
in DTM, that can take a long time.
(But only for the first time ).
5)
In the search dialog, you can search 
now for the name/email of an attendee
of an event/todo.
To get more space for displaying
search results, the buttons
for "search" and "close" on the 
bottom are removed in the PDA version. 
You have to click OK in the top right
corner to do a search.
6)
Now it is possible to disable the displaying
of todo items in the Allday part of the Agenda.
Choose Menu Action-Configure,
TAB Todo View, checkbox
"Allday Agenda view shows todos"
7)
If FastLoad is enabled, now the settings and the 
calendar data are saved, when KO/Pi is closed.
(If no Fastload is enabled, KO/Pi saves
the data as well, of course)
8)
The Agenda View has a minimize-splitter now,
such that the height of the allday part can be
changed quickly.

********** VERSION 1.9.0 ************
1)
KO/Pi is now merged with the new microKDE from KA/Pi.
KO/Pi accesses now KA/Pi as the addressbook.
The other ddressbook-plugins are not working any longer.
(It is planned, that later KA/Pi itself uses these plugins)
New versions of KO/Pi are only available
together with KA/Pi as the KDE-Pim/Pi package. 
2)
If you click on an attendee of a meeting in the
event viewer, a detailed summary of the 
attendee is shown.
