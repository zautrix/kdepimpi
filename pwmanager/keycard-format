<=========================>
<  Format of PwM-KeyCard  >
<=========================>
cardformat version: 0x01

The keycard has a small header area and a key-data body.

The header is built with the following scheme:

PWMKEYCARD
[CARDVER]
[CARD-ID]
[KEYDATA-LENGTH]


After this header, the key-data-body with the length
[KEYDATA-LENGTH] follows.

Explanation of the header-fields:

PWMKEYCARD is a magic string at the beginning of the card
to indentify the chipcard as a "pwm-keycard".

[CARDVER] is one byte for holding the card-format version.

[CARD-ID] are 4 bytes (an unsigned BIG-ENDIAN value)
to hold an ID number for the card.

[KEYDATA-LENGTH] are 2 bytes (an unsigned short) for holding
the length of the key-data in BIG-ENDIAN format.
