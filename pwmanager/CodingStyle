		PwManager coding style

This program is being developed with the linux-kernel coding-style
in mind. Please read these guidelines first, to get a basic
knowledge of the style. You can find it in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for example.

A few other guidelines apply to this program, too:

- Please use new-style C++ casts, if you need to make a cast.

- The class PwMDoc is _only_ for internal document-data-
  management. Don't put any view- or user-interface-stuff in
  it. Not even a MessageBox. You may use the class PwMDocUi
  to add UI-functionality to the document.

- Don't add any document related stuff to another class
  than PwMDoc. Exception: Put it into its own class and
  invoke this class from within PwMDoc.

- This program makes extensive use of inline functions, for
  example to access data-members from outside of the class.
  Please try to do so, too.

- Don't try to optimize code for speed, where speed doesn't
  matter. Instead optimize it for readability.

- In the code we use the string "PwM" instead of "PwManager",
  where needed. This has two reasons. The original name of
  this program was "PwM". The second reason is that it's shorter.

- It's an absolute requirement to have fun while developing
  code for this application.
